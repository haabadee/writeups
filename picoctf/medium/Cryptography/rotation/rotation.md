1. Sometimes rotation is right
# Solution
Since we are given the string `xqkwKBN{z0bib1wv_l3kzgxb3l_25l7k61j}` in the text file, we can see that the string is already in the correct format with the capital letters and the brackets. Paired with the title of this challenge, I can see that it's most likely a rotation cipher. Now I just have to plug it into a decoding website to get the flag.

Now I know that the flag is `picoCTF{r0tat1on_d3crypt3d_25d7c61b}`.
