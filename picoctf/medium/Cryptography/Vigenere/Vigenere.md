# Solution
Based on the emcpded text and the problem description along with the title, I assumed that this was just a vigenere cipher. However, since the problem gave us the key, it shouldn't be too difficult. After putting the information in an online vigenere cipher decoder, I can then get the flag.

Now I know that the flag is `picoCTF{D0NT_US3_V1G3N3R3_C1PH3R_d85729g7}`.
