# Hints
1. This is an introduction of format string vulnerabilities. Look up "format specifiers" if you have never seen them before.
2. Just try out the different options
# Solution
First, I took a look at the code to see what it did, and I noticed that the flag is printed when the `sigsegv_handler` is called, so I check to see where the method is called.

After looking around, we can see that the method is called when a segmentation fault occurs, so I just spam a bunch of A's as input.

It works!

Now I know that the flag is `picoCTF{7h3_cu570m3r_15_n3v3r_SEGFAULT_74f6c0e7}`.
