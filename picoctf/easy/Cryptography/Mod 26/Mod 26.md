1. This can be solved online if you don't want to do it by hand!
# Solution
This is a pretty straightforward solution, since the problem description literally tells you the cipher to use. Anyways, just search up any rot13 decoder and you'll get the flag.

Now I know that the flag is `picoCTF{next_time_I'll_try_2_rounds_of_rot13_hWqFsgzu}`.
